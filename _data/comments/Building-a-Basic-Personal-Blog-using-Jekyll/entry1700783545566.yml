message: "I think what you published made a bunch of sense.\r\n\r\nBut, think about this, suppose you wrote a catchier title?\r\n\r\nI ain't saying your information is not solid., however what if you added something that grabbed a person's attention? I mean Building a Basic Personal Blog using Jekyll | \r\nHenry Cole is a little vanilla. You ought to glance at Yahoo's home page and see how they create news headlines to get people \r\ninterested. You might add a related video or a related pic or two to get people excited about everything've got to say.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, it would bring your posts a little bit more interesting."
